<h2>Hi there.</h2>
<p>My name is Scott Whiting and I'm the proud owner of Whiting Electric. I'm a master electrician working in Hawaii and serving the island of Oahu. I specialize in servicing, troubleshooting, inspections and even sales for solar PV systems. But I can also do it all.<p>
<h2>Your home is your castle</h2>
<p>Nobody wants a grumpy electrician with a bad attitude skulking around their house. Trust your favorite place to someone who actually cares about the where you hang your hat.</p>
<h2>Houses are like people</h2>
<p>I love what I do and it shows in every project I work on. For me, there's no project too small because every single house has a different personality. I find fun problems to solve in every project. And for me, solving tough problems is what gets me up in the morning.<p>
